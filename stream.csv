You learn differently from others, sometimes online classes are easy for some, but the worst format for others. You are your own individual person, who shouldn't be compared to your sister just because her talents are more obvious to your parents. 

I think you should sit down with your parents and tell them you want to have a conversation where they listen to you. Think clearly about how to say it and then tell them in your own words how they have made you feel. Express your difficulties and let them know what can improve your learning, but have a plan. I think that will knock them off balance enough for everything you have to say to sink in a bit. Make sure to let them know this isn't an attack, but rather you trying to open the door for better communication with them, and deeper understanding. 

Be prepared to use the phrase ""I'm too emotionally charged to have a rational conversation about this, can we put this down for a while so I can get space and think about it"".

5G has three frequency bands- low-band, mid-band, and millimeter wave.

The most commonly deployed of those will be low-band which is identical to 4G networks. Mid-band will be the next most common and those frequencies are all around us including the wifi you are probably using to post your messages.

Millimeter wave is only new in terms of cell phones- but as I have said- the frequencies have been in use for years for other services.

Moreover- the frequencies in question cannot even penetrate the human body to any significant degree. In addition- the radiation itself is non-ionizing and the power levels involved are orders of magnitude lower than could even cause skin heating- let alone any actual damage.

So what, exactly, is supposed to be the concern here?

kafka123,t2_10l2kq,FALSE,FALSE,"Traditionally, conservatives are people who value old-fashioned values. They believe in traditional (eg religious) conceptions of gender, homosexuality, ethnicity and so on. Nowadays, however, the term ""Conservative"" has become a synonym for ""right wing conservative"". Although what counts as conservative depends on the culture and era, the main thing is that conservatives (theoretically) consider themselves to be ""grown ups"" who feel that people have to take responsibility for their own actions.

""Right wing"" people believe that people should work to improve themselves, but with the exception that people who already own things already deserve to have them based on the fact they've been given them, even if that hasn't been a product of their effort.

They believe that people should strive to do things themselves to get better, other people be damned. For instance, a right wing person might notice that a successful entrepreneur has managed to make a lot of money for themselves, but that someone else has a lousy job and is poorer, and point out that the entrepreneur has put more hard work and ingenuity into getting their own luck. 

The poor person might be lazy, or they might simply be unlucky and benefit from the help of other people, but according to conservatives, it isn't someone else's business to look after them, and while providing them with short-term help is a good thing if you've chosen to do so, providing them in the long term might be a bad thing and make them dependent.

In America, the right wing parties are known as ""Republican"". This means that they are in aid of the Republic of the United States. In the UK, ""Republican"", when not applied to Americans, refers to someone who doesn't want the royal family to rule the country, since that's what distinguishes a republic, like the US or France, from a Kingdom, like the United Kingdom.

""Left wing"" refers to people who feel that everyone has equal value, and that those who have less money are more likely to be down on their luck than lazy. 

Most, but not all, left wing people feel that it is the job of everyone to look after each other as a collective group, and that looking after people who are poorer or otherwise less fortunate is a duty, not a choice, and that people who neglect that duty should be held responsible for perpetuating the situation or making it worse.

Some left wing people hold Marxist views, and believe that the wealthiest members of society are exploiting the poorer ones for their own gain. 

Many left wing people feel that rich people should redistribute their wealth, either because they have more money than they need and deserve to help other people, or because they have made that money at other people's expense and owe them a higher return.

In the US, the main left wing group is known as the Democrat party, because they are more focused on ensuring the country is democratic than they are in supporting the nation.

Libertarians believe that each person is born with inalienable rights. They believe that authority figures, powerful individuals, majority groups and mob rule all seek to threaten the autonomy of individual people. In theory, libertarians believe that everyone should have the right to free speech and campaign against censorship.

Progressive libertarians campaign in favour of civil rights, as they feel that civil rights ensures the safety and autonomy of individual people.

Conservative libertarians are more sceptical of civil rights campaigns, as they feel that people should decide for themselves as individual people whether they have been offended or are at risk or not.

Some libertarians actively campaign against discrimination, seeing it as a threat to the rights of certain people and that businesses and organisations should serve everybody; others support discrimination, seeing it as the right of a business or organisation to decide who it gets to serve. 

Right-wing libertarians believe that it is up to individual people to make their own decisions, but that nobody should actively try to stop them; left-wing libertarians believe there are structural disadvantages that stop certain people, such as minorities, from being able to achieve their goals. 

Right-wing libertarians believe that the greatest threat to society comes from the government, that taxing people is a crime, and that attempts to get governments to regulate the power of corporations and other forms of businesses is counterproductive. 

Left-wing libertarians believe that taxes are only one of several issues, and that regulations can help prevent other authority figures, including corporations, from becoming too powerful.

Liberals are people who believe that society should be founded around rational principles and common sense. They are in favour of incremental changes, sceptical of grand, transformative ideas (excepting liberalism) and believe that people can be free within a loose structure. 

Traditionally, ""liberal"" referred to ""Classic"" liberals, who held many features in common with libertarians, but felt that people had to be rational, intelligent, and responsible in order for things to work out, which discounted certain people.

Nowadays, ""liberal"" tends to refer, somewhat pejoratively, to people with mainstream centrist views who profess to be left wing and favour the status quo.

Centrists are people who think that things should stay somewhat in the middle of the political spectrum. Centrists are often positioned as being mainstream, but this can be misleading, as holding the views that members of radical left and right wing groups share could also be viewed as centrist.

""Radical"" means that people have views that other people consider extreme, that require a complete change of tactic, or that go against the status quo.

""Socialists"" and ""communists"" believe, like other left-wing groups, that everyone should have equal levels of wealth. Most, but not all, socialists and communists believe that the wealth of rich people should be redistributed; a small minority believe in social and technical advances that could make everyone rich, and some feel that having too much money is superfluous in the first place.


Socialists believe that everyone should have the democratic right to do their own thing and pursue their own interests, but that people's lives should be equitable i.e. that everyone should have access to the same level of opportunity. Socialists believe that people should be trusted to share things themselves, or that the government should tax capitalist insitutitons to maintain a balance.

Communists believe that people should be expected to live in an equal society, and that everyone should be treated equally i.e. they get to have the same things. 

Communists believe that people should be given things equally in the sense that people can get handed out a ration, so that everybody gets their fair share, or that they should only own certain things to begin with. Many communists, but not all, believe that the former is best achieved by an authority figure like the government.

Anarchists reject all forms of authority, ideology and law, and believe that people should be trusted to do things by themselves. Anarcho-capitalists are in favour of doing this with money, so that people can have personal freedom, and support individual rights on a similar basis to libertarianism; they fear that socialist and communist plans will make people poor, instill a central authority to manage everything, or result in mob rule.

Anarcho-communists are like socialists; they believe that encouraging the use of money and businesses risks turning the society into mini-kingships ruled by businesses and corporations with no rules to contain them, that an anarchist society which allowed people to be unusually wealthy would be unequal, and that a society in which anarchists were too poor to manage themselves would be useless and a waste of time.",TRUE,FALSE,0,1589154218,2020-05-10T15:43:38Z,NA,0,t1_fq66doy,fq66doy,TRUE,FALSE,t3_gggm7u,t1_fq66doy,TRUE,t3_gggm7u,/r/RightwingLGBT/comments/gggm7u/what_are_the_differences_between_conservative/fq66doy/,1,gggm7u,RightwingLGBT,t5_3dc8i,0,1,2020-05-10T15:43:48Z

Toxic masculinity isnt the initiator, toxic masculinity is the outcome. Society and its unrealistic standards create toxic masculinity, one of the manifestations of which is unhealthy emotional repression of course as he explains. 

Logically, men withhold their emotions because of societal expectations, which then create toxic masculinity, which then presents itself as emotional repression.

Its pedantic and nitpicky, but given the name of the term and how it is often used to blame men for their own issues and suggest that anything a man suffers from is internal rather than the result of other people or institutions, I understand how people want to disassociate themselves with the term or have it as the reason for their issues.

A lot of the advice has been to block block BLOCK, which might be your best choice.

You are an entertainer, and while you may interact with him with a certain level of familiarity, there is absolutely NO intimate connection beyond the service (your content, your time, attention, etc) you provided, which he knowingly and willingly paid for. Any further attempts to contact you personally, or approach you or your home in real life will NOT be tolerated.

(Also, I’d consider adding a line or two insisting that you do not have something against him as a person per se, but it’s a boundary you’re firm about with ALL clients. Play a sympathy card if you need to. I know it sucks to feel the need to tend to his ego, but with guys like these, no mater how sweet they seem, I always consider that they might try to retaliate. I just say how it’s nothing against him personally, but it’s a firm boundary you won’t consider shifting for ANYONE, and he needs to understand that.)

Maybe him know you’d consider legal action if he persists or lashes out, and be prepared to follow through. I’ve never gotten a restraining order, but it’s not too difficult depending on your state/county.
